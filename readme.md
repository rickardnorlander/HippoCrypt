HippoCrypt is an email client that automatically encrypts emails to people with known encryption keys, and
automatically exchanges keys with the others.

For now only gmail is supported.

You will need gpg to use this. For windows users, please download http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html

To build, open the project file in Eclipse. Run the main function in HippoCrypt.java
