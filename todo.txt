Todo:
Better initial setup
Support for attachments
Support for text/html
Encrypt subject
Support for mail providers other than gmail
Comments
Run background stuff in one thread, currently background threads can trip over each other, for instance fetching the same mail twice
Maybe add support for cancelling slow tasks?
Uninstaller
Clean up UI

Keep in mind / done:

Disable all html for risky swing components
Run slow things off EDT (EventDispatchThread)
